# ðŸ’´ Expense Tracker ðŸ’´

Welcome to my final project of phase 3 at Flatiron! This is a Python-based CLI application for tracking monthly expenses. Add, edit, delete, filter, and aggregate expense entries stored in a SQL database.

## Installation

Fork this repository into your local files. `cd` into the repo and run `pipenv install`. Then, `pipenv shell` followed by `cd lib` and `./cli_script.py`.

## Modules

### cli_script.py

The entry point of the app, and the file that is run directly in the terminal. Contains title display and main menu. Heavy use of the `simple-term-menu` package.

### helpers.py
